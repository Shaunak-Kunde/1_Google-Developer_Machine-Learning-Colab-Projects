# Object-Oriented Programming in Python – Duke University

This project is part of the **Object-Oriented Programming in Python** course offered by Duke University. It is a guided, hands-on notebook designed to teach foundational OOP concepts through practical coding exercises and project implementations.

## 🧠 Project Overview

The project helps learners build strong software engineering foundations by teaching how to:

- Design and structure Python classes
- Encapsulate data using objects
- Apply principles of inheritance and polymorphism
- Develop reusable and modular code
- Apply real-world thinking in class-based design

This Jupyter Notebook includes examples, exercises, and mini-projects that demonstrate effective object-oriented techniques in Python.

## 📂 File

- `project_1_oop_python_duke.ipynb` – Main Jupyter Notebook containing all OOP lessons, examples, and implementations.

## 📌 Topics Covered

- **Classes and Objects**
- **Attributes and Methods**
- **Encapsulation**
- **Inheritance**
- **Polymorphism**
- **Modular Design**
- **Code Reuse and Refactoring**

## 📚 Prerequisites

- Basic knowledge of Python syntax and control structures
- Familiarity with Jupyter Notebooks

## ▶️ Getting Started

1. Clone or download this repository.
2. Open the notebook with JupyterLab, VS Code, or any compatible Jupyter environment.
3. Follow the instructions and execute code cells sequentially to complete the exercises.

## 🚀 Learning Outcome

By the end of this notebook, you'll be able to:

- Design classes that model real-world systems
- Write clean, maintainable, and scalable Python code
- Understand and apply the principles of OOP in software development

## 👨‍🏫 Instructor

This project is based on coursework provided by **Duke University**, hosted on platforms like Coursera.
