# Google Machine Learning Crash Course – Colab Projects

These notebooks are part of my learning journey during the Google for Developers Machine Learning Crash Course, completed as part of the SkillsWallet SmartInternz Virtual Internship Program. The course offered a practical, hands-on introduction to machine learning with interactive visualizations, exercises, and Colab-based notebooks.

Unlike synthetic or preprocessed datasets from Kaggle, these exercises focus on building foundational ML skills, working with raw or real-world-like data, and applying machine learning concepts end-to-end.

🚀 Key Learning Outcomes

Built regression and classification models from scratch, including linear and logistic regression.

Explored data preprocessing for numerical and categorical data using techniques like one-hot encoding and feature transformations.

Understood dataset characteristics, generalization, and overfitting.

Learned neural networks, embeddings, and an introduction to large language models (LLMs).

Explored production ML systems, AutoML, and responsible ML practices including fairness auditing.

# 🔑 Notes

All notebooks were created and executed in Google Colab.

Each notebook is self-contained, demonstrating a specific ML concept or workflow.

These projects collectively showcase practical application of ML fundamentals using Python.
